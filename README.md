# Developing Data Products Course Project - Part 1

The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a **Shiny application** and deploy it on **Rstudio's servers**. Second, we should use **Slidify or Rstudio Presenter** to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application. This repository has the **ui.R** and **server.R** files for the **first part (Part 1)**. 

The app developed for the **first part** of the assignment is available at: ***https://irzan3.shinyapps.io/nazri/***

The presentation for the **second part (Part 2)** is available at: ***http://rpubs.com/irzan3/148041***

Files for the app and presentation are available on the GitHub: ***https://github.com/irzan3/nazri***
