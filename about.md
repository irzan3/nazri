Welcome to **"Get your Dreamed Car"** app that was developed to help you choose your dreamed car using the mtcars dataset from R. The selection of cars are based on the car's characteristics that you choose as inputs.

The app will do the filtering based on your chosen characteristics i.e. the number of Cylinders, the gross Horsepower and the Transmission type. 

The table result will show only the cars that match your chosen characteristics. You can sort the table of result according to the variable that you want by clicking the arrows at the top of the respective column in the table.
